# Inverted-Pendulum-Control
The objective of this project is to design and implement a complete control system for an inverted pendulum. Control will be applied to the angle of the robotic body and to the position relative to the ground. Two nested control loops will be used in order to achieve this. MatLab is used as a tool to design the concept and a BeagleBone Blue running C-code is used to implement the design on the eduMIP platform provided by the UCSD Coordinated Robotics Lab.
